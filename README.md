# md2hyper

Markdown2Hypertext - a pretty bog standard CLI tool to convert Markdown docs to HTML files in <u>Java.</u>

> [!TIP]
> This project doesn't support **all** of Markdown, just the more common symbols found in most Markdown docs.

## Supported Markdown

```
<!-- comments are ignored. -->

# header1 -> <h1>

## header2 -> <h2>

### header3 -> <h3>

#### header4 -> <h4>

body text -> <p>

*italics1* -> <i>

_italics2_ -> <i>

<u> underline -> <u>

**bold1** -> <strong>

__bold2__ -> <strong>
```

Right now that is it. Things like code blocks, maybe even syntax highlighting for said code blocks may exist! Other features like lists (ordered and unordered) will be added overtime as my Java skills improves.
